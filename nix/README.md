## Notes for gems

Build an apppriate Gemfile (by hand seems ok) then get into a `nix-shell`:

```
$ nix-shell -p ruby bundix
$ bundle lock
$ bundix
``
> bundix doesnt seem to honor --gemfile and similar flags since import of pkg fails unless gemfile and gemfile.lock are local to *.nix file generated by bundix
